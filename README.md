# CHARA_Target_Checker
v0.1
-----
The CHARA Target Checker compares input parameters to the limits of various CHARA Array instruments to 
determine if useful data can be obtained for the target. This tool is meant primarily as a quick reference and 
not for observing planning.

The following target parameters are compared to the Array's limits:
* Declination
* R-band magnitude (for star tracking)
* R-, J-, H-, and/or K-band magnitude (for science)
* Angular Diameter
